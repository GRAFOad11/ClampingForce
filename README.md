How to Calculate Injection Molding Machine Tonnage

This is Console program with will Calculate Injection Molding Machine Tonnage for You.
Use Accurate Calculation Formula with two important factors in calculating clamping force: 
1.	Projected area (S) is the largest area viewed along mold opening and closing:
-	Cavity area
-	Runner area
-	Number of cavities 
2.	Determination of cavity pressure (P):
-	Location of injection gates
-	Wall thickness of product
-	Viscosity characteristics of plastics used
	
Program will save calculations in text file, named "Wyniki Oblicze≈Ñ.txt", also read history is available from console.
User Interface works in a way question/answer.
